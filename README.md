# Proxmox Backup Recovery Tools

A set of tools designed to recover lost clusters and missing chunks in Proxmox Backup due to `fsck` (file system check) operations or file system corruption. This project provides scripts that can be run in either Python or Bash, offering flexibility and compatibility.

## Features

### 1. Recovering Lost Clusters
The script `copy-clusters-in-lost-found.sh`:
- Identifies files moved to the `lost+found` folder during an `fsck` operation.
- Recreates the original folder structure of the clusters, enabling Proxmox Backup to recognize them again.

### 2. Recovering Missing Chunks
The script `copy-missing-chunks-in-log.sh` works in two stages:
1. **Log Generation**: Run a `verify` operation on Proxmox Backup to generate a log of errors. Save this log for the next step.
2. **Chunk Recovery**: Use the generated log and a separate, healthy Proxmox Backup disk as a parameter. This script extracts the problematic chunks from the healthy copy and replaces the corrupted ones on the original disk.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Proxmox Backup logs and access to both the corrupted disk and a healthy Proxmox Backup disk.

### Running the Scripts
- **Cluster Recovery**:
  ```bash
  ./copy-clusters-in-lost-found.sh /path/to/lost-found
  ```
- **Chunk Recovery:
Perform a verify in Proxmox Backup to generate the log of errors.
Use the log file to recover chunks:

  ```bash
   ./copy-missing-chunks-in-log.sh /path/to/error-log /path/to/healthy-disk
  ```

# Chunk Copy Script for Proxmox Backup Files

This script processes a `.fidx` index file from Proxmox Backup, identifies the required chunks, and copies them into a specified output folder, maintaining the original directory structure. It avoids copying duplicate chunks and shows progress as it runs.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7 or newer**: Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Git** (optional): If you are cloning the repository directly from version control.

## Installation Instructions

Choose one of the following methods to install and run the script: **Poetry**, **Python venv**, or **Conda**.

### Option 1: Using Poetry

1. **Install Poetry** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory** and **install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/project
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Activate the Poetry environment**:
   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

4. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python script.py --index /path/to/your/file.fidx --chunks /path/to/chunks --output /path/to/output
   ```

---

### Option 2: Using Python Virtual Environment (venv)

1. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python script.py --index /path/to/your/file.fidx --chunks /path/to/chunks --output /path/to/output
   ```

---

### Option 3: Using Conda

1. **Create a Conda environment**:
   ```bash
   conda create -n myenv python=3.8
   ```

2. **Activate the Conda environment**:
   ```bash
   conda activate myenv
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python script.py --index /path/to/your/file.fidx --chunks /path/to/chunks --output /path/to/output
   ```

---

## Script Usage

The script accepts three parameters:

- **`--index`**: Path to the `.fidx` file containing chunk indices.
- **`--chunks`**: Directory where chunk files are stored, with subfolders `0000` to `FFFF`.
- **`--output`**: Destination folder where chunks will be copied.

**Example Command**:
```bash
python script.py --index "/backup/backup2/vm/163/2024-06-15T23:01:44Z/drive-virtio0.img.fidx" --chunks "/backup/backup2/.chunks" --output "/desired/output/path"
```

---

### requirements.txt

This script requires only the `tqdm` package. Ensure you have this dependency listed in your `requirements.txt`:

```
tqdm
```

---

With these instructions, you can set up and run the chunk copy script using your preferred environment management tool.
